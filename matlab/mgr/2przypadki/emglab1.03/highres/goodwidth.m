function w = goodwidth (width, dt)% GOODWIDTH		Find highly composite odd number%	GOODWIDTH (N) returns a highly composite odd number%	that is greater than or equal to N. This number%	provides an efficient length for trigonometric polynomials.%%	GOODWIDTH (W, DT) returns a length in seconds that %	corresponds to an efficient odd number of samples when%	the sampling interval is DT.% Copyright (c) 2006-2009.
