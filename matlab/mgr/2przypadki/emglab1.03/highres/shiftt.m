function y = shiftt (x, d);% SHIFTT Circular time shift. %    Y = SHIFTT (X, D) -> returns a shifted version of vector X. The%    shifting distance D has to be an integer scalar. Y will have the same %    size as Y. If X is a matrix, all its columns will be shifted with%    the same distance D.% Copyright (c) 2006-2009. Kevin C.
