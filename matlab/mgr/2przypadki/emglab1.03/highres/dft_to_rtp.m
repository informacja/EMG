function p = dft_to_rtp (c, lx);% DFT_TO_RPT  Convert from DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) %    to RPT (Real Trigonometric Polynomial) format.%%    P = DFT_TO_RPT (C, LX)  ->	returns the RTP coefficients%    corresponding to the DFT coefficients in the column vector C. %    If C is a matrix, the conversion is applied to each column.%    This function only accesses the "positive-frequency" DFT%    coefficients (i.e., C(1:ceil((LX+1)/2),:), so the negative-frequency%    ones need not be present.%    LX is the length of the time signal to which C and P correspond.% %    See also RPT_TO_DFT% Copyright (c) 2006-2009.
