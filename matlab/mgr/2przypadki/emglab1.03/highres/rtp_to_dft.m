function [c, lx, l2] = rtp_to_dft (p)% RPT_TO_DFT Convert from RTP (Real Trigonometric Polynomial) %    to DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) format.%     %    C = RPT_TO_DFT (P) ->	returns the DFT coefficients corresponding to %    RTP coefficients in the column vector P. If P is a matrix, the conversion%    is applied to each column. Note that only the "positive-frequency" DFT%    coefficients are returned, i.e., C(1:ceil((LX+1)/2),:), where LX is%    the length of P.%%    [C,LX,L2]= RPT_TO_DFT (P) ->	the number of RTP coefficients is returned %    in the scalar lx; l2 is the number of sine (or cosine) coefficients. % %    See also DFT_TO_RPT% Copyright (c) 2006-2009.
