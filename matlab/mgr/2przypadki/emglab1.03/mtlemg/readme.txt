Montreal EMG Decomposition Package (MTLEMG)The Montreal EMG Decomposition Package is a multi-channel version of the decomposition algorithm by Florestal, Mathieu, and Malanda [1, 3]. It includesa genetic algorithm for resolving superimpositions [2]. It can process single-or multi-channel signals.The MTL software is now included in the standard EMGlab download available atwww.emglab.net. You can also download just the MTL software without EMGlab. This package is written in Matlab, and requires Matlab 7.0 or higher. It does not require any Matlab toolboxes. This package should run on any computer, but it is most efficient on Windows computers because certain routines have been pre-compiled into dll files. To run the stand-alone version, call the function Matlab function "mtlemg":     annotation = mtlemg (signal, rate, option); Inputs:     signal:      the EMG signal to be decomposed. It can be either a vector                   (single-channel) or a matrix (multi-channel). Vector or                   matrix orientation (i.e., nxm vs. mxn) is unimportant.                   For best results, the input signal should be high-pass                  filtered, with a cut-off frequency between 500 and 1000 Hz.     rate:        Sampling rate in Hz. The sampling rate is a positive scalar.      option:      This input is optional. If set to 1, then the genetic                   algorithm will be used to resolve superimpositions. Output:      annotation:  a 1xn cell structure, where n is the number of channels.                   Each cell is a dx2 matrix, where d is the total number of                   discharges identified in each individual channel. For each                   row of the matrix, the first and second columns represent the                  detected time occurrence in seconds and the MU ID,                   respectively. Also note that MU numbering is consistent                   across channels, e.g. MU #1 in channel 1 will be the same as                  MU #1 in channels 2 through n.   The signals and expert annotations used to validate the MTLEMG algorithm in [3]are available as data set R008 at http://www.emglab.net.References[1] Florestal JR, Mathieu PA, Malanda A.
